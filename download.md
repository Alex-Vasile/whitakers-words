You may download runnable copies of Whitaker's WORDS here:

The preservation efforts for Whitaker's WORDS are currently focused on
keeping the underlying programme source code working; the links above
do *not* provide runnable copies of our efforts, but equivalent
programmes compiled some years ago, and we can't vouch for their
reliability.  We expect to be able to distribute runnable versions of
the up-to-date code by October 2015.
