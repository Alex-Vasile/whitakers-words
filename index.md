Summary
=======

This program, WORDS, takes keyboard input or a file of Latin text lines and
provides an analysis of each word individually.  It uses an INFLECT.SEC,
UNIQUES.LAT, ADDONS.LAT, STEMFILE.GEN, INDXFILE.GEN, and DICTFILE.GEN, and
possibly .SPE and DICT.LOC.

The dictionary contains over 39000 entries, as would be counted in an
ordinary dictionary.  This expands to almost twice that number of
individual stems (the count that the program may display at startup), and,
through additional word construction with hundreds of prefixes and
suffixes, may generate more, leading to many hundreds of thousands of
'words' that can be formed by declension and conjugation.  This version of
WORDS provides a tool to help in translations for the Latin student.  It
is now a large dictionary by any measure and can be helpful to advanced
users.  The dictionary will continue to grow - slowly.
