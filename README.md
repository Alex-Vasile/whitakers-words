WORDS

This is a cleaned-up version of the port of William Whitaker's WORDS
programme, a Latin-English dictionary with inflectional morphology
support; the original author passed away in 2010, so any and all help
maintaining the software as development and execution environments evolve
would be greatly appreciated.
