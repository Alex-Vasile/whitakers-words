<A NAME="SUMMARY">
<H2><CENTER>SUMMARY</CENTER>
</H2></A> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
This program, WORDS, takes keyboard input or a file of Latin text lines and
provides an analysis of each word individually.  It uses an INFLECT.SEC,
UNIQUES.LAT, ADDONS.LAT, STEMFILE.GEN, INDXFILE.GEN, and DICTFILE.GEN, and
possibly .SPE and DICT.LOC.
<P>
The dictionary contains over 39000 entries, as would be counted in an
ordinary dictionary.  This expands to almost twice that number of
individual stems (the count that the program may display at startup), and,
through additional word construction with hundreds of prefixes and
suffixes, may generate more, leading to many hundreds of thousands of
'words' that can be formed by declension and conjugation.  This version of
WORDS provides a tool to help in translations for the Latin student.  It
is now a large dictionary by any measure and can be helpful to advanced
users.  The dictionary will continue to grow - slowly.  <BR>
<BR>




<A NAME="TESTS AND STATUS">
<H3><CENTER>TESTS AND STATUS</CENTER>
</H3></A> <BR>

<A NAME="Testing">
<H4>Testing</H4></A>

<P>
The program has been run against common classical texts.  Initially
this was mostly a check of the process and reliability of the program.  It
is now possible to run real texts and get valid statistics.  Relatively
few texts have been run multiple times in order to understand exactly
where failure occured and to regression test the solutions.  Such testing
has taken place on texts totaling well over a million words.  The best
results come from those which have been run the most times.  Caesar and
the Vulgate are essentially without unknowns (excluding proper names.,
Seutonius and Virgil are at the 0.1% level, Varro and Pliny have somewhat
more than 1% unknowns due to their specialized vocabulary.  While this is
a mechanical test and does not assure that the form and meaning reported
by the program is always correct, the actual number of misses found by
limited detailed examination is vanishingly small.

<P>
A far larger test (with feedback) has been made by John White in the development
of his Blitz Latin.  While not using WORDS, he has a program from much the
same basis, incorporating approximately the WORDS dictionary.  He has run
a much larger set of texts, including both classical and medieval, to the
extent of 20 million Latin words, and provided significant unknowns
to be included in WORDS.

<P>
The hardest test is against another dictionary.  While getting a 97+% hit
rate on long classical texts, a run against a large dictionary might fall
to 85-90%, the missing words being in those letters which the update has
not reached.  This is to be expected, since we both have the 10000 most
common words and have made somewhat different additions beyond that.  So
large electronic wordlists are a check on the program, and have been reserved
for that purpose, not simply incorporated as such.

<P>We have gone so far that this is no longer significant and wordlists can be
integrated.  The only real impact has been the inclusion of modern Latin words
which come from such lists, and not from scans of texts.

<BR>
<BR>



<H5>English-to-Latin Tests</H5>

<P>So far there have been no formal validation of the English-to-Latin capability.
There have been numerous individual checks and anacdotal testing, as well
as some mechnical performance tests, but nothing fundemental.

<P>The first test proposed is to take a small English-to-Latin dictionary,
say from the back of an introductory textbook, and check that the Latin
suggested for each entry is found in the top six returned by WORDS.
It is expected that there will be a high corespondence (to be shown).
Taking a much larger example may give a different result.
It may be that the Latin words chosen by WORDS are not the same as
the paper dictionary.

<BR><BR>


<A NAME="Current Status and Future Plans">

<H4>Current Status and Future Plans</H4></A>
<P>
The present phase of refinement has incorporated the Oxford Latin
Dictionary and Lewis and Short entries into <B>D</B> (about a fourth).
Periodically, when I need a change of task, I run a major author
to check the
effectiveness of the code.  I may then include some words which turn up
frequently as unknowns, but this is done as the spirit moves me.  Smaller
sections of later authors may also be processed, giving some growth in
medieval Latin entries.  Recently I have worked the Vulgate of St. Jerome.

<P>John White in support of his Blitz Latin program has run a very large
body of Latin text, including much medieval legal documents.  He provides
input to the dictionary as he finds significant unknowns.

<P>
I will continue to refine the dictionary and the program.  The major goal
is to complete the inclusion of OLD and L+S, and this may take years.
Along the way, and later, I will expand to medieval Latin.  I am not so
unrealistic as to believe that I will 'finish', indeed, this is a hobby
and there is no advantage to finishing.
<P>
An eventual outcome would be to have some institution, with real Latin
capability, provide an exhaustive and authoritative program of this
nature.  Until then, I and other individuals will make available our
programs.  <BR>

<A NAME="Writing DICT.LOC and UNIQUES.LAT">
<H4>Writing DICT.LOC and UNIQUES.LAT</H4></A>
<P>
To make the dictionary files used by the program is not difficult, but it
takes several auxiliary programs for checking and ordering which are best
handled by one center.  These are available to anyone who needs them, but
it is better that any general additions to the dictionary be handled
centrally that they can be included in the public release for everyone.
<P>
However, it is possible for a user to enhance the dictionary for special
situations.  This may be accomplished either by providing new dictionary
entries in a DICT.LOC file, those to be processed in the regular manner,
or to add a unique (single case/number/gender/...) in a text file called
UNIQUES.  <A NAME="DICT.LOC">

<H4>DICT.LOC</H4></A>
<P>
A dictionary entry for WORDS (in the simplest, editable form as read in a
DICT.LOC) is

<PRE><TT>
aqu   aqu
N    1 1 F T     X X X X X
water;

</TT></PRE>

<P>
For a noun there are two stems.  The definition of STEM is inherent in
the coding of inflections in the program.  Different grammars have
different definitions.  There is no formal connection with any other
usage.
<P>
To these stems are applied, as appropriate, the endings

<PRE><TT>
         S       P
NOM      a       ae
GEN      ae      arum
DAT      ae      is
ACC      am      as
ABL      a       is
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Or rather, the input word is analyzed for possible endings, and when these
are subtracted a match is sought with the dictionary stems.  A file
(INFLECTS.LAT) gives all the endings.

<P>
In this example, the first line
<PRE><TT>
aqu   aqu
</TT></PRE>
contains the two noun stems for the word found in printed dictionaries as

<PRE><TT>
aqua, -ae
</TT></PRE>

<P>
The second line

<PRE><TT>
N    1 1 F T     X X X X X
</TT></PRE>
says it is a noun (N), of the first declension, first variant, is feminine
(F), and is a thing (T), as opposed to a person, location, etc.  The X X X
X X represents coding about the age in which it is applicable, the
geographic and application area of the word, its frequency of use, and the
dictionary source of the entry.  None of this is necessary in a DICT.LOC
although something must be filled in and X X X X X is always satisfactory.

<P>
The last line is the English definition.  It can be as long as 80
characters.

<PRE><TT>
water;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
The case and exact spacing of the stems and codes is unimportant, as long
as they are separated by at least one blank.
<P>
The PART_OF_SPEECH_TYPE that you are most interested in are (X, N, ADJ,
ADV, V).  X is always a valid entry.  It stands for none, or all, or
unknown.  0 has the same function for numeric types.
<P>
The others in the type (PRON, PACK, VPAR, SUPINE, PREP, CONJ, INTERJ, NUM,
TACKON, PREFIX, SUFFIX) are either less interesting or artificial, used
only internally to the code.
<P>
A noun or a verb has a DECN_RECORD consisting of two small integers.  The
first is the declension/conjugation, and the second is a variant within
that.
<P>
N 1 1 is the conventional first declension.  But there are variants (6, 7,
8) which model Greek-line declensions.  (Greek-like variant start at 6);
<P>
N 2 1 is the regular -us, -i second declension.
<P>
N 2 2 is the regular -um, -i neuter form.
<P>
There is a N 2 3 for 'r' forms like puer, pueri.  In this case there is
the possibility of a difference in stems (ager, agri has stems coded as
ager, agr).
<P>
Again there are Greek-like variants (6, 7, 8, 9).
<P>
N 3 1 is regular third declension (lex, legis - lex, leg) for masculine
and feminine.
<P>
N 3 2 is for neuter (iter, itineris - iter, itiner).
<P>
Variants 3 and 4 are for I-stems.  And so it goes.
<P>
Each noun has a GENDER_TYPE (X, M, F, N, C).  X for unknown (something I
avoid for gender - guess if you have to) or all genders (useful in the
code but not in a dictionary), and C for common (M + F).
<P>
There is also a

<PRE><TT>
NOUN_KIND_TYPE (X,            --  unknown, nondescript
                N,            --  proper Name
                L,            --  Locale, country, city
                W,            --  a place Where
                P,            --  a Person type
                T)            --  a Thing
</TT></PRE>
which you probably do not care about either.  Most entries will all be
Thing.
<P>
Other codes are enumerated in the body of this document.
<P>
Verbs are done likewise, but there are four stems, as described below.  An
example is

<PRE><TT>
am  am  amav  amat
V 1 1 X    X X X A O
love;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Now comes the hard part.  When starting from a dictionary one has all the
information to decide the values.  Just having a single instance of the
word lacks a lot.  Consider some examples from a user.
<P>
Elytris is surely from the Greek for sheath.  The question is how
Latinized did it get.  I suspect that by the 17th century it was
completely Latinized.  Even in classical times there was very little left
in the way of Greek forms ( elythris (or -es), elythris (N 3 3) but it
could be a Greek-like form (N 3 9).  I do not even know what case I
started with, if NOM, then it must be -is, -is, if GEN then -es, -is is
reasonable.  Then again, if it is DAT P we might have a N 1 1.
<P>
All this seems very uncertain, and, in the absence of a real dictionary
entry, it is.  However you can make the choices such that the result (the
output of the code) matches exactly what you have.  If you have more
information, lots of examples, the uncertainty shrinks.  If you have just
a single isolated example, there are limits.  (But if you do 100 and have
more information about some, you can make better guesses about the rest.)
<P>
Next we need a gender.  It may not make much difference (if M or F, or C)
in this case, but sometimes it matters.  You might be able to figure that
out from the text.
<P>
It is a thing (T), but X will work for your purposes.  For the rest, X X X
X X works fine.
<P>
So we have

<PRE><TT>
elythris   elythr
N   3 3  F T       X X X X X
elytra, wing cover of beetles
</TT></PRE>

<P>
sat, I happen to know is an abbreviated form of satis, so it is easy.  If
you want the adverb form, as you indicate:

<PRE><TT>
Sat
ADV POS     X X X X X
sufficiently, adequately; quite, well enough; fairly, (moderately)
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Adverbs have a comparison parameter (X, POS, COMP, SUPER).  Most will be
POS.
<P>
It also is an indeclinable (N 9 9) substantive:

<PRE><TT>
sat
N 9 9 N T     X X X X X
enough, sufficient; enough and some to spare; one of sufficient power

</TT></PRE>

<P>
Deplanata seems to be a 1-2 declension adjective, the -us, -a, -um form.
It also seems to derived from the verb deplanto (V 1 1) - break off/sever
(branch/shoot).

<PRE><TT>
deplanat   deplanat
ADJ 1 1 POS     X X X X X
broken off/severed (branch/shoot); (flattened)
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Adjectives have a DECN and a comparison.
<P>
The following were not at the time in the dictionary, but were in the OLD.

<PRE><TT>
alat  alat
ADJ 1 1 POS     X X X X X
winged, having wings; having a broad/expanded margin


(punct - ul - at  -> hole/prick/puncture - small - having)

punctulat   punctulat
ADJ 1 1 POS    X X X X X
punctured; having small holes/pricks/stabs/punctures

appendiculat   appendiculat
ADJ 1 1 POS    X X X X X
appendiculate; having/fringed by small appendages/bodies


acetabul   acetabul
N 2 2 N T     X X X X X
small cup (vinegar), 1/8 pint; cupped part (plant); sucker; socket, (cavity)


ruf  ruf
ADJ   1 1 POS     X X X X X
red (various); tawny; red-haired (persons); strong yellow/moderate orange


testace   testace
ADJ  1 1 POS    X X X X X
bricks; resembling bricks (esp. color); having hard covering/shell (animals)
</TT></PRE>

<P>
This one had no classical correspondence.

<PRE><TT>
brunne   brunne
ADJ 1 1  POS     X X X X X
brown
</TT></PRE>

<P>
There is one other remark.  It is probably wise to include in the
definition a more complete English meaning.  Just saying the meaning of appendiculatus is
appendiculate is not as interesting as it might be.
<P>
All the inflections are in a file called INFLECTS.LAT now a part of the
general distribution of <A HREF="http://www.erols.com/whitaker/wordsall.zip">source code and data files</A>.  <BR>

<A NAME="UNIQUES.LAT">

<P>
There are a few Latin words that cannot be represented with the scheme of
stems and endings used by the program.  For these very few cases, the
program invokes a unique procedure.  The file UNIQUES.  contains a list of
such words and is read in at the loading of the program.  This is a simple
ASCII/DOS text file which the user can augment.  It is expected that there
will be very few occasions to do so, indeed, the tendency has been that
better processing has allowed uniques to be removed.  If a user finds an
important word that should be included, please communicate that to the
author.
<P>
The UNIQUES record is essentially the form as one might have it in output
if the word was processed normally.  In addition there are some additional
fields that the program presently expects.  While these could be
eliminated, it is convenient for the program not to make the UNIQUES a
special case.  So a noun form

<PRE><TT>
N 3 1 ACC S F T
</TT></PRE>
is followed by two zeros and an X

<PRE><TT>

The program is written in Ada and uses Ada techniques.  Ada is designed
for high reliability systems (there is no claim the WORDS was developed
with all the other safeguards that that implies!) as a consequence is
unforgiving.  The exact form is required.  If you want to be sloppy you
have to deliberately program that in.
<P>
The following examples, and an examination of the UNIQUES.LAT file, should
allow the user to insert any unique necessary.
