<A NAME="SUMMARY">
<H2><CENTER>SUMMARY</CENTER>
</H2></A> <BR>

<P>
This program, WORDS, takes keyboard input or a file of Latin text lines and
provides an analysis of each word individually.  It uses an INFLECT.SEC,
UNIQUES.LAT, ADDONS.LAT, STEMFILE.GEN, INDXFILE.GEN, and DICTFILE.GEN, and
possibly .SPE and DICT.LOC.
<P>
The dictionary contains over 39000 entries, as would be counted in an
ordinary dictionary.  This expands to almost twice that number of
individual stems (the count that the program may display at startup), and,
through additional word construction with hundreds of prefixes and
suffixes, may generate more, leading to many hundreds of thousands of
'words' that can be formed by declension and conjugation.  This version of
WORDS provides a tool to help in translations for the Latin student.  It
is now a large dictionary by any measure and can be helpful to advanced
users.  The dictionary will continue to grow - slowly.  <BR>
<BR>


<A NAME="ENGLISH to LATIN">
<H3><CENTER>ENGLISH to LATIN</CENTER>
</H3></A> <BR>


<P>A fairly new application for the WORDS dictionary has been an attempt to
go English to Latin.
Up to now there is no satisfactory computer facility for this.
The best on the net is a search of the Perseus dictionary,
finding all uses of the English word in the text of the dictionary.
One can do the same with the WORDS dictionary,
and DICTPAGE.TXT is a convenient form for that purpose.
In the present release of WORDS, a primitive English-to-Latin
facility has been implemented, based on this inverted dictionary method.

<P>However, except for very simple situations,
the resulting raw output can be excessive and often spurious.
It is necessary to TRIM the output for the general user.
In order to do this, one needs to be able to computer parse the MEAN field
and prioritize the significance of a word appearing therein.
This is a more rigorous requirement than the one applied hitheretofore,
that MEAN should be human-readable.  Now it must be computer parsed.
Therein lies the reason for a formal set of rules for constructing MEAN.
These rules are new and certainly have not been applied throughout
the dictionary yet, further,
they may change in the future if more powerful ordering algorithms evolve.

<P>The primary rule is that nothing should surprise or
inconvenience the casual user of WORDS.
Further, for system independence,
the MEAN line should be readable by anyone in ASCII,
without special characters or fonts.


<P>I have just begun to work on an English-to-Latin capability.
Initially this is just a inversion of the WORDS Latin dictionary,
extracting all the English words in the MEAN field of the WORDS dictionary
and associating these with the corresponding Latin entry.
A real English-to-Latin is much more than that.
To construct from first principles,
one should take a set of English words and find the Latin equivalent,
not the reverse.
Nevertheless, WORDS now has some primitive capability.

<P>The raw inversion produces almost 200_000 English words.
WEEDing them by the present algorithms (eliminate a, the, to, ...,
and a number of common modifiers when included in meanings not of
their part of speach)
reduces this number only by a third.
But this finally results in only somewhat over 20_000 unique words,
less than the number of Latin entries!
This probably reflects more on dictionary makers than on the languages.


<P>English is certainly a far richer lanaguage than Latin, measured
by the number of individual words.
WORDS has about 40_000 Latin entries, and the corresponding inversion to
English yields only 22_000 unique English words.


<P>The reason seens to be that,
while English may have lots of words for love or hate,
in making up a Latin
dictionary one will opt to give a simple translation.
So while love is a proper translation of a number of Latin words,
and one could as well replace it with any of dozens of English synonyms,
a dictionary compiller will usually take the simplest English word
that provides the reader with the meaning.   That is what the reader usually wants.


<P>Starting from an English basis to produce an English-to-Latin dictinoary
gives an entirely different outcome.
In that case, the full power of English can be invoked,
and it is the Latin that will seem simple by comparison.

<P>In many cases, an English-to-Latin dictionary bound in the same volume
as a Latin-to-English will have been
developed by a different author, and sometimes they are not consistent.
At least the inversion procedure assures basic consistency.

<P>One problem with the inversion method is that one needs
to weed out a lot of the chaff before presenting to the user.
And even then there are a lot of choices for the user.
GOLD occurs 120 times; COPPER, 57 times: ABANDON, 24 times,
plus several times for ABANDONED, ABANDONS, ABANDONING, and ABANDONMENT.
Further trimming has to get very severe!



<P>If the program is run with TRIM_OUTPUT parameter set
(this parameter works on both Latin and English output),
the six highest priority (by FREQ or whatever the current algorithm is)
will be listed.  This should serve for the general user.
Turning off this parameter allows the program to list all instances
found in the Latin dictionary,
which were not removed by WEEDing in the data preparation.

<P>Finally there is the problem that most paper Latin dictionaries harken back
to the 19th century or earlier, even those published more recently.
Their base English may not be current.
Take a purely hypothetical example.  On the first page of every English-Latin
dictionary is <B>abase</B>.  This is a good 18th century word.  Today one is
more likely to see humble, degrade or humiliate, and those are the words the
user is more likely to request.  But the dictionaries from which WORDS draws
may be fonder of abase as the meaning of a Latin word which could serve for
any of these.  The user may want to try some synonyms, but this can be
a considerable burden.  A built-in thesaurus could mechanically generate
a broad range of words to include, but this is surely overkill and will
generate so many inappropriate results as to render the search excessively
cumbersome.  The user is advised to check the meanings returned for suggestions
as to what other words might be tried, if the immediate result does not
seem satisfactory.


<P>One important point is that the program mechanically searches the Latin dictionary.
If one is looking for a adjective, presently one will find all adjectives for which the
MEAN contains the search word, no more.  However one should be aware that
participles of appropriate verbs can also serve as adjectives and may be
a better choice.

<P>At the present time there is no complex constrution/deconstruction
of the English input.  Thus if the input is 'kill', only Latin entries
with the exact word 'kill' in their MEAN will be selected.  The suffixed words
'kills'/'killing'/'killed'/'killer'/etc. will not be found.  They must
be queried seperately.
Likewise, unlike the Latin phase of WORDS, prefixes are not extracted.
It may be desirable in the future to provide such additional capabilities.
This would be value added over simple search by the program.



<BR>
<BR>


<A NAME="English Parsing of Meanings">
<H4>English Parsing of Meanings</H4></A>
<BR>


<P>Puncuation in meanings is now formalized, in order
to allow computer processing of the text.
Diviation from these rules would make parsing
of the English very difficult, so they must be enforced.
There is nothing which will mislead the user,
but it goes beyond standard text practice.


<P>The semicolon separator has greater significance.
Various groups of meanings may have varying frequency or likelihood.
The most likely are placed first and thereby prioritized.
Within a semicolon group (SEMI) of meaning/synonyms separated by commas or slashes,
their probability is assumed to be the same.
Where possible, a PURE word (e.g., 'perhaps') should lead,
followed by compound meanings (e.g., 'it may be').
There is much work to do before this ordering is complete.

<P>Any PURE meaning (one not involving modifiers) set off by
commas or slashes, is assigned a high priority on output that
a modified/compound meaning in the same MEAN SEMI.

<P>Semicolons seperate meaning groups that have a different
flavor/sense.
Initially the interpretation and selection among these were left
to the user, as in paper dictionaries.
Recent requirements demand an ordering of these groups.
The order of the semicolon groups (called SEMIs in the code) should
indicate the frequency or probability of that meaning
among different groups, where this inferrence can be made.
This ideal is not yet rigorously enforced, even in recent entries,
and less so in those earlier in the update.

<P>Commas separate meanings that are roughly equivalent -
synomyns. In parsing, a COMMA consistes of the words between commas.
There is no inherent logical order within a SEMI, however,
to support another application for the dictionary,
full sentence Latin-to-English translation,
it is desirable to be able to pick a single,
simple, modern English word that is most likely to be the translation.
This should be the first word of the meaning.

<P>Question marks and exclamation points may appear as
an integral part of the meaning.  They do not replace
the comma/semicolon separator, as in normal text.

<P>The soldius/slash (/) does the work of 'or' in many cases.
It is used solely to conserve space,
to compress the meaning line to no more than 80 characters.
It separates (generally close) synonyms and
also alternative options (jump up/out = jump up; jump out).

<P>Plus (+) is used in the dictionary, as well as in this documentation,
in place of ampersand, for compatibility with HTML.
It s a full separator, between two words, each recognized separately.

<P>Hyphen (-) should be is used in the dictionary only to break
into two words in the parse, each recognized separately.
Thus, book-keeper will appear in the English pharse as two words.
But it is likely that a user looking for an accountant would search
for bookkeeper, rather than book or keeper.
The dictionary has not yet been scrubbed for this situation.

<P>Parentheses set off both possible supporting words
(go (down) = go; go down) and explanatory information.
Since parenthesized words are excluded from the extraction process,
they are a way to further reduce clutter in the English dictionary.
Words in the meaning that should not find this entry when searched
can be excluded from the English dictionary tables by parenthesizing.
(NOTE: two sets of parentheses not separated by a comma or semicolon
can cause processing troubles and should be avoided.)

<P>Square brackets enclose translation examples or idioms,
a Latin expression to English equivalent.
The English translation of the Latin is introduced by =>.
The parser expects this (=>) token.
A bracketed expression is always
at the end of the meanings line so that it may be
extracted before spellchecking, otherwise the spellcheck
will fail on the Latin and there are an inconveniently large
number of these examples.
Brackets should never be use where parentheses are appropriate.

<P>Generally, articles (a, an, the) are omitted in meanings.
While this compresses the line, it also reflects the fact
that Latin does not distinguish between those uses.
To define agricola as 'a' farmer would disparage the possiblity
of the proper translation being 'the' farmer.  Most dictionaries
report nouns without an article.  This one go further and
avoids the use of articles almost everywhere.

<P>Some dictionaries prefix verb meanings with TO.
This is superfulous, except in the case of a list of meanings
not distinguished by part of speech (to cut, a cut), not
the situation for this dictionary.

<P>Vertical bars at the begining indicate continuation meaning lines.
There may be several continuation lines,
numbered/ordered by the number of leading vertical bars.
For words with a large number of meanings,
additional meaning lines are provided by another entry for the same stems
and part with what amounts to a continuation line for MEAN.
In order to associate the resulting series of meaning lines,
a vertical bar (|)is placed at the begining of the
first continuation MEAN, two bars for the second, etc.
The dictionary is sorted so as to assure that
these entries are grouped and ordered.
This allows checking  of the dictionary for spurious duplicate entries
without flagging intended continuation entries.
Further it facilitates compression
of the WORDS output by combining the inflection output for the several
identical parts followed by the group of meaning lines.
The STEMS and PART are identical for the base (no |) and all extensions.
They are all the same word, however they may have different flags,
that is, there may be different meanings for different AGE or AREA.

<P>The bar is a code for MEAN continuation seen only in the raw DICTLINE.
Bars are removed before WORDS output and are not visible to the user.
There are also some entries with identical STEMS and PART which are
really different words,
different derivation and completely different meanings.
These will not be | coded and will be reported separately in output.
{NOTE: The vertical bar should not appear anywhere in meanings except
at the begining as a continuation flag.)

<P>Correct use of symbols/codes in MEAN is very important.
One must not use them 'free form'.
They are used in the parsing of MEAN and inproper use can defeat a processing program.
While some main programs have many built-in checks,
there are a number of secondary tools which are not so 'fool proof'.
MAKEEWDS is a complicated program which I did not do well.
If it hits something strange it might well fail to properly
parse that MEAN.  The program will still complete and the
output will only lose a part of the strange MEAN, affecting only the English mode,
and may or may not not give a report on the failure.


<A NAME="Ordering English-to-Latin Output">
<H4>Ordering English-to-Latin Output</H4></A>
<BR>


<P>Essentially we start by associating English words in the dictionary entry meaning
with the entry number (line number in DICTLINE).
The list of English words (EWDSLIST) is sorted so that all occurances of a particular word are together.
Then, upon inquiry, a list of the associated Latin dictionary entries is output.
Unfortunately this list could be large (a hundred or more for some common words) and thereby user-unfriendly.
The task is to order the list and reduce the output to a few most likely


<P>Priorities for display are based on frequencies.  Besides the basic
FREQ assigned to the entry, it is presumed that the frequency is
greater for those meanings in the first SEMIs, with gradually
decreasing frequency assigned to later SEMIs and to bar flagged continuations.
The algorithm presently used is summarized below,
but it is subject to modification in future versions.






<P>Each English word found is given a numerical RANK/priority/weight based on the algorithm below.
The numerical values of each consideration are added or subtracted to give the priority of the entry.



<H5>FREQ</H5>

<P>The obvious choice for frequency weights might be the comparative paper dictionary citations,
which would be roughly:

<PRE><TT>
A=>50
B=>25
C=>10
D=> 5
E=> 3
F=> 1</TT></PRE>


<P>However these would weight the A frequency so heavily
that it would be impossible to overcome with anything
that could be applied to lower frequencies.  So we must reject this scale
for a more managable set:

<PRE><TT>
A=>70
B=>60
C=>50
D=>40
E=>30
F=>20
etc.</TT></PRE>


<P>(N is special case, add 25 after formula)

<H5>Compounds</H5>

<P>Compound words ('very tall' vs. 'tall') are often useful,
indeed the user may be looking for components to make up a compound translation,
however generally they should be disparaged relative to the pure/simple word.
A compound A FREQ might be no better than a pure D.
<BR>
<BR>
Compound Yes=> 0<BR>
Compound No (Pure) =>  10<BR>
<BR>

Which SEMI (a SEMI is a part of MEAN set off by semicolons)<BR>
<BR>

-3 per SEMI  after 1

<P>Further, a word on a continuation line is disparaged by 3 SEMIs (-9).


<P>The words in the first SEMI are enhanced in the expectation that they are
the primary meaning.  This follows the tenuous idea that there is a single simple
translation for each English word.  At least the first SEMI is emphasized. <BR>
<BR>

If PURE and 1st SEMI => 5<BR>

<P>Priority = FREQ value + Compound value + SEMI value + Continuation value + First SEMI value <BR>
<BR>


Example: for lamp - lanum N 3 2 N

<PRE><TT>
FREQ A => 70
Compound No => 10
Semi 2 => -3
Continuattion Line No => 0
Pure 1st No => 0
RANK/priority => 77</TT></PRE>





<A NAME="TESTS AND STATUS">
<H3><CENTER>TESTS AND STATUS</CENTER>
</H3></A> <BR>

<A NAME="Testing">
<H4>Testing</H4></A>

<P>
The program has been run against common classical texts.  Initially
this was mostly a check of the process and reliability of the program.  It
is now possible to run real texts and get valid statistics.  Relatively
few texts have been run multiple times in order to understand exactly
where failure occured and to regression test the solutions.  Such testing
has taken place on texts totaling well over a million words.  The best
results come from those which have been run the most times.  Caesar and
the Vulgate are essentially without unknowns (excluding proper names.,
Seutonius and Virgil are at the 0.1% level, Varro and Pliny have somewhat
more than 1% unknowns due to their specialized vocabulary.  While this is
a mechanical test and does not assure that the form and meaning reported
by the program is always correct, the actual number of misses found by
limited detailed examination is vanishingly small.

<P>
A far larger test (with feedback) has been made by John White in the development
of his Blitz Latin.  While not using WORDS, he has a program from much the
same basis, incorporating approximately the WORDS dictionary.  He has run
a much larger set of texts, including both classical and medieval, to the
extent of 20 million Latin words, and provided significant unknowns
to be included in WORDS.

<P>
The hardest test is against another dictionary.  While getting a 97+% hit
rate on long classical texts, a run against a large dictionary might fall
to 85-90%, the missing words being in those letters which the update has
not reached.  This is to be expected, since we both have the 10000 most
common words and have made somewhat different additions beyond that.  So
large electronic wordlists are a check on the program, and have been reserved
for that purpose, not simply incorporated as such.

<P>We have gone so far that this is no longer significant and wordlists can be
integrated.  The only real impact has been the inclusion of modern Latin words
which come from such lists, and not from scans of texts.

<BR>
<BR>



<H5>English-to-Latin Tests</H5>

<P>So far there have been no formal validation of the English-to-Latin capability.
There have been numerous individual checks and anacdotal testing, as well
as some mechnical performance tests, but nothing fundemental.

<P>The first test proposed is to take a small English-to-Latin dictionary,
say from the back of an introductory textbook, and check that the Latin
suggested for each entry is found in the top six returned by WORDS.
It is expected that there will be a high corespondence (to be shown).
Taking a much larger example may give a different result.
It may be that the Latin words chosen by WORDS are not the same as
the paper dictionary.

<BR><BR>


<A NAME="Current Status and Future Plans">

<H4>Current Status and Future Plans</H4></A>
<P>
The present phase of refinement has incorporated the Oxford Latin
Dictionary and Lewis and Short entries into <B>D</B> (about a fourth).
Periodically, when I need a change of task, I run a major author
to check the
effectiveness of the code.  I may then include some words which turn up
frequently as unknowns, but this is done as the spirit moves me.  Smaller
sections of later authors may also be processed, giving some growth in
medieval Latin entries.  Recently I have worked the Vulgate of St. Jerome.

<P>John White in support of his Blitz Latin program has run a very large
body of Latin text, including much medieval legal documents.  He provides
input to the dictionary as he finds significant unknowns.

<P>
I will continue to refine the dictionary and the program.  The major goal
is to complete the inclusion of OLD and L+S, and this may take years.
Along the way, and later, I will expand to medieval Latin.  I am not so
unrealistic as to believe that I will 'finish', indeed, this is a hobby
and there is no advantage to finishing.
<P>
An eventual outcome would be to have some institution, with real Latin
capability, provide an exhaustive and authoritative program of this
nature.  Until then, I and other individuals will make available our
programs.  <BR>

<A NAME="Writing DICT.LOC and UNIQUES.LAT">
<H4>Writing DICT.LOC and UNIQUES.LAT</H4></A>
<P>
To make the dictionary files used by the program is not difficult, but it
takes several auxiliary programs for checking and ordering which are best
handled by one center.  These are available to anyone who needs them, but
it is better that any general additions to the dictionary be handled
centrally that they can be included in the public release for everyone.
<P>
However, it is possible for a user to enhance the dictionary for special
situations.  This may be accomplished either by providing new dictionary
entries in a DICT.LOC file, those to be processed in the regular manner,
or to add a unique (single case/number/gender/...) in a text file called
UNIQUES.  <A NAME="DICT.LOC">

<H4>DICT.LOC</H4></A>
<P>
A dictionary entry for WORDS (in the simplest, editable form as read in a
DICT.LOC) is

<PRE><TT>
aqu   aqu
N    1 1 F T     X X X X X
water;

</TT></PRE>

<P>
For a noun there are two stems.  The definition of STEM is inherent in
the coding of inflections in the program.  Different grammars have
different definitions.  There is no formal connection with any other
usage.
<P>
To these stems are applied, as appropriate, the endings

<PRE><TT>
         S       P
NOM      a       ae
GEN      ae      arum
DAT      ae      is
ACC      am      as
ABL      a       is
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Or rather, the input word is analyzed for possible endings, and when these
are subtracted a match is sought with the dictionary stems.  A file
(INFLECTS.LAT) gives all the endings.

<P>
In this example, the first line
<PRE><TT>
aqu   aqu
</TT></PRE>
contains the two noun stems for the word found in printed dictionaries as

<PRE><TT>
aqua, -ae
</TT></PRE>

<P>
The second line

<PRE><TT>
N    1 1 F T     X X X X X
</TT></PRE>
says it is a noun (N), of the first declension, first variant, is feminine
(F), and is a thing (T), as opposed to a person, location, etc.  The X X X
X X represents coding about the age in which it is applicable, the
geographic and application area of the word, its frequency of use, and the
dictionary source of the entry.  None of this is necessary in a DICT.LOC
although something must be filled in and X X X X X is always satisfactory.

<P>
The last line is the English definition.  It can be as long as 80
characters.

<PRE><TT>
water;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
The case and exact spacing of the stems and codes is unimportant, as long
as they are separated by at least one blank.
<P>
The PART_OF_SPEECH_TYPE that you are most interested in are (X, N, ADJ,
ADV, V).  X is always a valid entry.  It stands for none, or all, or
unknown.  0 has the same function for numeric types.
<P>
The others in the type (PRON, PACK, VPAR, SUPINE, PREP, CONJ, INTERJ, NUM,
TACKON, PREFIX, SUFFIX) are either less interesting or artificial, used
only internally to the code.
<P>
A noun or a verb has a DECN_RECORD consisting of two small integers.  The
first is the declension/conjugation, and the second is a variant within
that.
<P>
N 1 1 is the conventional first declension.  But there are variants (6, 7,
8) which model Greek-line declensions.  (Greek-like variant start at 6);
<P>
N 2 1 is the regular -us, -i second declension.
<P>
N 2 2 is the regular -um, -i neuter form.
<P>
There is a N 2 3 for 'r' forms like puer, pueri.  In this case there is
the possibility of a difference in stems (ager, agri has stems coded as
ager, agr).
<P>
Again there are Greek-like variants (6, 7, 8, 9).
<P>
N 3 1 is regular third declension (lex, legis - lex, leg) for masculine
and feminine.
<P>
N 3 2 is for neuter (iter, itineris - iter, itiner).
<P>
Variants 3 and 4 are for I-stems.  And so it goes.
<P>
Each noun has a GENDER_TYPE (X, M, F, N, C).  X for unknown (something I
avoid for gender - guess if you have to) or all genders (useful in the
code but not in a dictionary), and C for common (M + F).
<P>
There is also a

<PRE><TT>
NOUN_KIND_TYPE (X,            --  unknown, nondescript
                N,            --  proper Name
                L,            --  Locale, country, city
                W,            --  a place Where
                P,            --  a Person type
                T)            --  a Thing
</TT></PRE>
which you probably do not care about either.  Most entries will all be
Thing.
<P>
Other codes are enumerated in the body of this document.
<P>
Verbs are done likewise, but there are four stems, as described below.  An
example is

<PRE><TT>
am  am  amav  amat
V 1 1 X    X X X A O
love;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Now comes the hard part.  When starting from a dictionary one has all the
information to decide the values.  Just having a single instance of the
word lacks a lot.  Consider some examples from a user.
<P>
Elytris is surely from the Greek for sheath.  The question is how
Latinized did it get.  I suspect that by the 17th century it was
completely Latinized.  Even in classical times there was very little left
in the way of Greek forms ( elythris (or -es), elythris (N 3 3) but it
could be a Greek-like form (N 3 9).  I do not even know what case I
started with, if NOM, then it must be -is, -is, if GEN then -es, -is is
reasonable.  Then again, if it is DAT P we might have a N 1 1.
<P>
All this seems very uncertain, and, in the absence of a real dictionary
entry, it is.  However you can make the choices such that the result (the
output of the code) matches exactly what you have.  If you have more
information, lots of examples, the uncertainty shrinks.  If you have just
a single isolated example, there are limits.  (But if you do 100 and have
more information about some, you can make better guesses about the rest.)
<P>
Next we need a gender.  It may not make much difference (if M or F, or C)
in this case, but sometimes it matters.  You might be able to figure that
out from the text.
<P>
It is a thing (T), but X will work for your purposes.  For the rest, X X X
X X works fine.
<P>
So we have

<PRE><TT>
elythris   elythr
N   3 3  F T       X X X X X
elytra, wing cover of beetles
</TT></PRE>

<P>
sat, I happen to know is an abbreviated form of satis, so it is easy.  If
you want the adverb form, as you indicate:

<PRE><TT>
Sat
ADV POS     X X X X X
sufficiently, adequately; quite, well enough; fairly, (moderately)
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Adverbs have a comparison parameter (X, POS, COMP, SUPER).  Most will be
POS.
<P>
It also is an indeclinable (N 9 9) substantive:

<PRE><TT>
sat
N 9 9 N T     X X X X X
enough, sufficient; enough and some to spare; one of sufficient power

</TT></PRE>

<P>
Deplanata seems to be a 1-2 declension adjective, the -us, -a, -um form.
It also seems to derived from the verb deplanto (V 1 1) - break off/sever
(branch/shoot).

<PRE><TT>
deplanat   deplanat
ADJ 1 1 POS     X X X X X
broken off/severed (branch/shoot); (flattened)
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Adjectives have a DECN and a comparison.
<P>
The following were not at the time in the dictionary, but were in the OLD.

<PRE><TT>
alat  alat
ADJ 1 1 POS     X X X X X
winged, having wings; having a broad/expanded margin


(punct - ul - at  -> hole/prick/puncture - small - having)

punctulat   punctulat
ADJ 1 1 POS    X X X X X
punctured; having small holes/pricks/stabs/punctures

appendiculat   appendiculat
ADJ 1 1 POS    X X X X X
appendiculate; having/fringed by small appendages/bodies


acetabul   acetabul
N 2 2 N T     X X X X X
small cup (vinegar), 1/8 pint; cupped part (plant); sucker; socket, (cavity)


ruf  ruf
ADJ   1 1 POS     X X X X X
red (various); tawny; red-haired (persons); strong yellow/moderate orange


testace   testace
ADJ  1 1 POS    X X X X X
bricks; resembling bricks (esp. color); having hard covering/shell (animals)
</TT></PRE>

<P>
This one had no classical correspondence.

<PRE><TT>
brunne   brunne
ADJ 1 1  POS     X X X X X
brown
</TT></PRE>

<P>
There is one other remark.  It is probably wise to include in the
definition a more complete English meaning.  Just saying the meaning of appendiculatus is
appendiculate is not as interesting as it might be.
<P>
All the inflections are in a file called INFLECTS.LAT now a part of the
general distribution of <A HREF="http://www.erols.com/whitaker/wordsall.zip">source code and data files</A>.  <BR>

<P>

<A NAME="UNIQUES.LAT">
<H4>UNIQUES.LAT</H4></A>
<P>
There are a few Latin words that cannot be represented with the scheme of
stems and endings used by the program.  For these very few cases, the
program invokes a unique procedure.  The file UNIQUES.  contains a list of
such words and is read in at the loading of the program.  This is a simple
ASCII/DOS text file which the user can augment.  It is expected that there
will be very few occasions to do so, indeed, the tendency has been that
better processing has allowed uniques to be removed.  If a user finds an
important word that should be included, please communicate that to the
author.
<P>
The UNIQUES record is essentially the form as one might have it in output
if the word was processed normally.  In addition there are some additional
fields that the program presently expects.  While these could be
eliminated, it is convenient for the program not to make the UNIQUES a
special case.  So a noun form

<PRE><TT>
N 3 1 ACC S F T
</TT></PRE>
is followed by two zeros and an X

<PRE><TT>
N 3 1 ACC S F T  0 0                            X        X  X  X  B  O
</TT></PRE>
and then the five X's or, more properly, the dictionary codes.

<PRE><TT>
N 3 1 ACC S F T  0 0                            X        X  X  X  B  O
</TT></PRE>

<P>
These pro forma codes are absolutely necessary, but have no further
impact.
<P>
The program is written in Ada and uses Ada techniques.  Ada is designed
for high reliability systems (there is no claim the WORDS was developed
with all the other safeguards that that implies!) as a consequence is
unforgiving.  The exact form is required.  If you want to be sloppy you
have to deliberately program that in.
<P>
The following examples, and an examination of the UNIQUES.LAT file, should
allow the user to insert any unique necessary.
