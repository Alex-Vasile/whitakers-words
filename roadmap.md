Whitaker's last release of WORDS was (roughly) v1.97.

It is proposed to release a [v1.98](https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.98) with binary downloads for
Windows, MacOS and Debian/Ubuntu Linux and generic source code, to ensure
the release process itself works.

Further in the future (expected 2016):

* [v1.99](https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.99) : add a test suite with reasonable coverage of the main parser; make WORDS' main functionality available as a library
* [v2.0](https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av2) : add support for macrons
